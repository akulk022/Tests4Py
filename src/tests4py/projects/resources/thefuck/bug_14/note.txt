Thefuck 14 has a function that takes self parameter of Fish class such that :
f = Fish()
f._get_overridden_aliases()
Therefore there are only 5 passsing tests by default (if no overridden alias are added) or gives error if cannot get any.
So there are 5 passing system and unittests and 1 failing test that gives the error retrieving alias message.
