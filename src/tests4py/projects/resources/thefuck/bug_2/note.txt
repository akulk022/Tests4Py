Bug2 of API thefuck does not take any input values, instead it gets environment value of the system path.
Broken line only takes unix/linux systems` PATH, whereas Fixed line of code can also parse Windows OS PATH
 which is separated by ; instead of : (PATH separator for Linux = ':' and for Windows = ';')

-            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(':')
+            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(os.pathsep)
