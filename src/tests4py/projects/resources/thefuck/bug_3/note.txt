First version uses the fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command to get the version of the Fish shell.
It relies on the $FISH_VERSION environment variable to fetch the version information.

Second version uses the fish --version command to obtain the Fish shell version.
It captures the output of this command and processes it to extract the version information.
It does not rely on an environment variable like $FISH_VERSION.

In the original code, it relies on the echo $FISH_VERSION command and
expects the version information to be explicitly set in the $FISH_VERSION environment variable.
In the modified code, it uses the standard --version flag,
which is a common convention for obtaining the version information of command-line tools.
