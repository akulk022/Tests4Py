-> System works with dnf --help and it needs Fedora to be used properly thus it does not work in macOS.
We only need to call _get_operations() because it takes --help content with dnf and uses it with _parse_operations()

def _parse_operations(help_text_lines):
    # The regex has to be a bytes-style regex since reading from a file
    # like stdin returns a bytes-style object and a string-style regex
    # wouldn't work.
    operation_regex = re.compile(b'^([a-z-]+) +', re.MULTILINE)
    return operation_regex.findall(help_text_lines)


def _get_operations():
    proc = subprocess.Popen(["dnf", '--help'],
                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
                            stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
    lines = proc.stdout.read()

    return _parse_operations(lines)
